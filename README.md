#Train Cancellations in Great Britain 
##PSY 6422 Data Analysis & Visualisation

This project took shape within the first few weeks of the semester as the early morning trains I needed to take to Sheffield were cancelled more often than not. My initial idea was to visualise train cancellations on a map of the UK, but limitations of the data set soon put an end to that. The scope had to be narrowed from the UK to just Great Britain as data for Northern Ireland was not included and showing the amount of cancellations on a map would not be very useful without the ability to normalise the data.

Data was collected from the Rail Data Marketplace. The raw data is not included as it clocks in at 18.1GB at the time of writing. There is however a rar file that contains a csv file with all the data used in this project within the data sub folder. Should you wish to obtain the raw data yourself, you can do so by registering a user at the Rail Data Marketplace. For more information refer to the readme file in the raw sub folder and the code book in the data sub folder.

While I do touch on a possible correlation between cancellations and weather events, no inferential analyses were conducted, this project is purely descriptive in nature. To see the final product simply follow the link under "About" on the top right on this page.
